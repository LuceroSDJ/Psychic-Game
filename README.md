## Ready! Set! Press a key!
### I will think of a letter. Then, you must guess the letter I am thinking of! How exciting!
### Please follow the instructions and conditions:

* Press the key you think is in my mind right now.

* If you guess incorrectly, you get a losing point.
* Keep in mind you have 10 chances to guess the letter correctly.
